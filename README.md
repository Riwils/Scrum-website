## Welcome

#This is my website. Here I will show you all the things I have learned about SCRUM

### A summary
 What is Scrum?
Scrum is a framework that helps teams work together. Scrum encourages teams to learn, organise and continuously reflect to improve productivity.

Its principles and lessons can be applied to all kinds of workplace teams not just software development, although that may be where it is the most popular.

The framework
Scrum is a framework for actual work productivity, where agile is a mindset. Scrum is structured to help teams naturally adapt to changing conditions and user requirements, with re-prioritization built into the process and short release cycles so your team can constantly learn and improve.

The product backlog is constantly revisited, re-prioritized and maintained by the Product Owner because, as we learn more or as the market changes, items may no longer be relevant or problems may get solved in other ways.

Sprint Backlog is the list of items, user stories, or bug fixes, selected by the development team for implementation in the current sprint cycle. Before each sprint, in the sprint planning meeting (which we’ll discuss later in the article) the team chooses which items it will work on for the sprint from the product backlog. However, the fundamental sprint goal – what the team wants to achieve from the current sprint – cannot be compromised.

Sprint Goal or Increment is the tangible goal for a sprint.
At the end of the planning meeting, every team member needs to be clear on what can be delivered in the sprint and how the increment can be delivered.

Sprint: A sprint is the actual time period when the scrum team works together to finish an increment. The goal of the daily scrum is for everyone on the team to be on the same page, aligned with the sprint goal, and to get a plan out for the next 24 hours.

The stand up is the time to voice any concerns you have with meeting the sprint goal or any blockers.

A common way to conduct a stand up is for every team member to answers three questions in the context of achieving the sprint goal:

• What did I do yesterday?
• What do I plan to do today?
• Are there any obstacles?

This review meeting is also when the product owner reworks the product backlog based on the current sprint, which can feed into the next sprint planning session. For a one-month sprint, consider time-boxing your sprint review to a maximum of four hours.

Sprint retrospective: The retrospective is where the team comes together to document and discuss what worked and what didn’t work in a sprint, a project, people or relationships, tools, or even for certain ceremonies. The idea is to create a place where the team can focus on what went well and what needs to be improved for the next time, and less about what went wrong.

Three essential roles for scrum success
A scrum team needs three specific roles: product owner, scrum master, and the development team. And because scrum teams are cross-functional, the development team includes testers, designers, UX specialists, and ops engineers in addition to developers. Effective product owners:

Build and manage the product backlog.
Closely partner with the business and the team to ensure everyone understands the work items in the product backlog.
Give the team clear guidance on which features to deliver next.
Decide when to ship the product with a predisposition towards more frequent delivery.

The product owner is not always the product manager. No development team wants mixed guidance from multiple product owners.

The scrum master
Scrum masters are the champions for scrum within their teams. They coach teams, product owners, and the business on the scrum process, and look for ways to fine-tune their practice of it.

An effective scrum master deeply understands the work being done by the team and can help the team optimize their transparency and delivery flow. As the facilitator-in-chief, he/she schedules the needed resources (both human and logistical) for sprint planning, stand-up, sprint review, and the sprint retrospective.

The scrum development team
Scrum teams get things done. All members of the team help one another to ensure a successful sprint completion.

The scrum team drives the plan for each sprint. Quick releases keep the team motivated and the users happy as they can see progress in a short amount of time.
