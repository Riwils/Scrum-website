<h1>Scrum</h1>

<h2>What is Scrum?</h2>
Scrum is a framework that helps teams work together. Scrum encourages teams to learn through experiences, self-organise while working on a problem, and reflect on their wins and losses to continuously improve.

Its principles and lessons can be applied to all kinds of workplace teams not just software development although that may be where it is the most popular.

<p>
Scrum is a framework for tangible productivity, whereas agile is the mindset. Scrum is structured to help teams naturally adapt to changing conditions and user requirements, with re-prioritisation built into the process with short release cycles so a team can constantly learn and improve.

<h3><strong>The scrum framework</strong></h3>
Scrum execution can be tailored to the needs of any organization. The product backlog is constantly revisited, re-prioritized and maintained by the Product Owner because, as we learn more or as the market changes, items may no longer be relevant or problems may get solved in other ways.

<h3><em>Sprint Backlog</em></h3> is the list of items, user stories, or bug fixes, selected by the development team for implementation in the current sprint cycle. Before each sprint, in the sprint planning meeting the team chooses which items it will work on for the sprint from the product backlog. However, the fundamental sprint goal – what the team wants to achieve from the current sprint – cannot be compromised.

<h3><em>Increment or Sprint Goal</em></h3> is the usable end-product from a sprint.
At the end of the planning meeting, every scrum member needs to be clear on what can be delivered in the sprint and how the increment can be delivered.

A sprint is the actual time period when the scrum team works together to finish an increment. The goal of the daily scrum is for everyone on the team to be on the same page, aligned with the sprint goal, and to get a plan out for the next 24 hours.

<h3>Three essential roles for scrum success</h3>
<p>A scrum team has three specific roles: product owner, scrum master, and the development team
<ul>
<li>The product owner</li>

<li>The scrum master</li>
Scrum masters are the champions for scrum within their teams. They coach teams, product owners, and the business on the scrum process, and look for ways to fine-tune their practice of it.
An effective scrum master understands the work being done by the team and can help the team optimize their transparency and delivery flow. As the facilitator-in-chief, he/she schedules the needed resources (both human and logistical) for sprint planning, stand-up, sprint review, and the sprint retrospective.

<li>The scrum development team</li>
Scrum team get things done. All members of the team help one another to ensure a successful sprint completion.
Each team drives the plan for each sprint. Quick releases keep the team motivated and the users happy as they can see progress in a short amount of time.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
A thing to remember, Scrum can take time to master, especially if the development team is acclimatised to the typical waterfall model.

<p>
The stand up is the time to voice any concerns you have with meeting the sprint goal or any blockers.

A common way to conduct a stand up is for every team member to answers three questions in the context of achieving the sprint goal:
<ul>
<li>What did I do yesterday?</li>
<li>What do I plan to do today?</li>
<li>Are there any obstacles?</li>
</ul>
This review meeting is also when the product owner reworks the product backlog based on the current sprint, which can feed into the next sprint planning session. For a one-month sprint, consider time-boxing your sprint review to a maximum of four hours.
